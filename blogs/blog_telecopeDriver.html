            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My brother recently got a telescope and we have been having a blast with it. It isn't a particularly expensive one; totaled out to about $350 dollars. You can see Jupter's big red dot and Saturn's rings. It is absolutely stunning.
                However, one thing you quickly disocver is how tiring and tedious it can be aligning your telescope on the planet <i>justttt</i> right. Once you do, the planet has quickly moved out of frame! In an effort to resolve this issue quickly,
                I searched the internet for cheap motorized platforms to move the telescope automatically instead of manually. That is where the biggest problem arose. They can be pricey. So, I sought to create a motorized telescope stand on a budget with
                an autonamous upgrade path for the future!

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project will be a fun change from my previous projects. We will be dealing in eletrical, mechanical, and electro-mechanical design. With this in mind, we will have to focus on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Picking proper components: </strong> We will need precise motors and a beefy microcontroller for future upgrade paths.</li>
                <li><strong>Portability; Integration Shield (PCB): </strong> I'd like to integrate all these components into a tight package since this stand will have to be portable.</li>
                <li><strong>Good Mechanical Design: </strong> So that this stand can work well, we will need robust mechanical design for precision, stability, and portability.</li>

                    <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 1px;">The Teensy 4.0 is a ARM Cortex-M7 at 600 MHz based development board. </td>
                    <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 1px;">I like this board because it is compact, extremely powerful (good for future upgrades) but most importantly it supports a wideee range of software. This includes Arduino IDE, Micro Python, Visual Micro, etc.
                        This is extremely important in case we want to use open source tracking software or star-gazer software in the future.

                    <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">These motors come with a 48mm body and 1.68A rated current, integrated a planetary gearbox of 26.85:1 gear ratio. </td>
                    <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">These excel at low speed, high torque applications. They are also compact, making it perfect for this application.
                        The step angle of the stepper motor alone is 0.067 degrees making it very precise. Lastly, the added planetary gearbox greatly improves our torque from 52Ncm -> 5Nm.

                    <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">These are the go-to stepper motor driver for applications like CNCs and 3D Printing. If you want precise movement in an integrated package, this
                        the driver to get. It fits our requirements perfectly as we won't be driving higher than 12V, 2A. Additionally, these come with easy control pins (meaning easy programming) and heat sinks to prevent
                        overheating.

                    <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">This will be used to power our Teensy 4.0. I wanted a reliable, clean power source as our Teensy will be powering our motor drivers.

                <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">Sadly, V1 of this project can't be a fully autonomous beast, so this joystick will be used to manually control the motors.

            <h2>Creating the Shield (PCB)</h2>
            <p>The neat thing about this project's component selection is that we don't need to source JLCPCB components. Many of the boards already did that for us. So, we need to integrate them together. This board will be used
                mainly to connect these components together in a compact way while also helping distribute power in a consolidated way.
            </p>
            <p>This block diagram helps break down the main component connection a little bit.</p>
            <img src="../images/images_motor/block_diagram.jpg" alt="Block Diagram">

            <p>Does it make sense? Great! This leads us to our schematic. This might look a little different. Remember, we are dealing with nets. I.e signals, voltages, etc all tied together through connectors, headers, and pins.</p>
            <p>With that in mind, we can create the schematic.</p>
            <img src="../images/images_motor/schematic.png" alt="Schematic">

            <p> You may notice a few differences. I added some LEDs to confirm things are working properly. Some dip switches help us select the step size we want for our motor drivers. Next, we have the addition of two electrolytic
                capacitors. The datasheet of the A4988 Stepper Motor Driver lists these decoupling capacitors are nessessary to help filter out noise from the power supply. We also have an additional pins from the Teensy 4.0 exposed with 
                header pins to help in our future upgrade path and for ease of prototyping as needed. Lastly, we have a spot for a fuse so that we protect our sensitive components from being burnt.
            </p>
            <p> You also may be wondering why I didn't list out specific components for the dip switches, leds, capacitors, fuse, etc. I designed this board with through-hole components in mind and many of these components I will size and pick 
                from scraps I have laying around my workshop (size correctly, of course). Keep in mind you can't just solder any capacitor to the board, for example. You have to size it correctly, preferrably with a low ESR, properly voltage derated cap.
